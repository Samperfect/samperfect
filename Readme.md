 my shrine is all-encompassing; so come, let's do juju together!

- to find me anywhere, just search for **opensaucerer**
- i create open tools people can use in their everyday life
- i try to advocate for more open-source development
- i'm currently experimenting with [these exciting ideas](https://abbrefy.xyz/projects)
- i'm probably giving *Rust* and *Julia* a run for my money
- i'm open to talking about anything and everything
